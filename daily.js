Input will be two integers:

N / n (Ruby) vertical position of Red Knight (0 or 1).
P / p (Ruby) horizontal position of two pawns (between 2 and 1000000).
Output has to be a tuple (python, haskell, Rust, prolog, C#), an array (javascript, ruby), an object (java), or a structure (C) with:

"Black" or "White" - which pawn was caught
Where it was caught (horizontal position)

function redKnight(N, P) {
  return "hello world";
};

console.log(redKnight(0, 8)); // should return ['White', 16]
